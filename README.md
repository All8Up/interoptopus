## Interoptopus üêô

The polyglot bindings generator for your library.

Write a robust library in Rust, easily access it from your second-favorite language:

- Design a single `.dll` / `.so` in Rust, consume it from anywhere.
- Get QoL features (e.g., classes, strings) in languages that have them.
- Always have a sane, C-compatible API.
- Painless workflow, no external tooling required.
- Easy to support more languages, backends fully decoupled from main project.

We strive to make our generated bindings _zero cost_. They should be as idiomatic
as you could have reasonably written them yourself, but never magic or hiding the interface
you actually wanted to expose.



### Code you write ...

```rust
use interoptopus::{ffi_function, ffi_type, Inventory, InventoryBuilder, function};

#[ffi_type]
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f32,
    pub y: f32,
}

#[ffi_function]
pub fn my_function(input: Vec2) {
    println!("{}", input.x);
}

// Define our FFI interface as `ffi_inventory` containing
// a single function `my_function`. Types are inferred.
pub fn ffi_inventory() -> Inventory {
    InventoryBuilder::new()
        .register(function!(my_function))
        .validate()
        .inventory()
}

```

### Getting Started üçº

If you want to ...
- **get started** see the [**hello world**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/examples/hello_world),
- **productify your project**, see the [**real project layout**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/examples/real_project_layout),
- **understand what's possible**, see the [**reference project**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src),
- **support a new language**, [**copy the C backend**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/backend_c).

### Supported Rust Constructs

See the [**reference project**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src) for an overview:
- [functions](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src/functions.rs) (freestanding functions and delegates)
- [types](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src/types.rs) (composites, enums, opaques, references, ...)
- [constants](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src/constants.rs) (primitive constants; results of const evaluation)
- [patterns](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/crates/reference_project/src/patterns) (ASCII pointers, options, slices, classes, ...)


### Performance üèÅ

Generated low-level bindings are _zero cost_ w.r.t. hand-crafted bindings for that language.

That said, even hand-crafted bindings encounter some target-specific overhead
at the FFI boundary (e.g., marshalling or pinning in managed languages). For C# that cost
is often nanoseconds, for Python CFFI it can be microseconds.

While ultimately there is nothing you can do about a language's FFI performance, being aware of call costs
can help you design better APIs.

Detailed call cost tables can be found here: <sup>üî•</sup>

- [**C# call overhead**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/tests/tests/csharp_benchmarks/RESULTS.md)
- [**Python call overhead**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/tests/tests/cpython_benchmarks/RESULTS.md)

For a quick overview, this table lists the most common call types in _ns / call_:

| Construct | C# | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primitive_void()` | 7 | 272 |
| `primitive_u32(0)` | 8 | 392 |
| `many_args_5(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)` | 10 | 786 |
| `callback(x => x, 0)` | 43 | 1168 |

### Feature Flags

Gated behind **feature flags**, these enable:

- `derive` - Proc macros such as `ffi_type`, ...
- `serde` - Serde attributes on internal types.
- `log` - Invoke [log](https://crates.io/crates/log) on FFI errors.

### FAQ

- [FAQ and Safety Guides](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/FAQ.md).


### Contributing

PRs are welcome.

- Submit small bug fixes directly. Major changes should be issues first.
- Anything that makes previously working bindings change behavior or stop compiling
  is a major change;
- This doesn't mean we're opposed to breaking stuff just that
  we'd like to talk about it before it happens.
- New features or patterns must be materialized in the reference project and accompanied by
  an interop test (i.e., a backend test running C# / Python against a DLL invoking that code)
  in at least one included backend.
