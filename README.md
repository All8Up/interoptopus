## Interoptopus üêô

The polyglot bindings generator for your library (C#, C, Python, ...)

<br>

Huh?
- Imagine you are writing this cool API and want the world to have it.
- The world, however, is running Unity, C, Python, ... all at the same time.
- "Not a problem", you say, "I'll just use Interoptopus".

And you'll live happily<sup>*</sup> ever after.

<sub>*Actual results may depend on other life choices.</sub>

### Code you write ...

```rust
use interoptopus::{ffi_function, ffi_type, inventory};

#[ffi_type]
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Vec2 {
    pub x: f32,
    pub y: f32,
}

#[ffi_function]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn my_function(input: Vec2) {
    println!("{}", input.x);
}

inventory!(ffi_inventory, [], [my_function], []);

```

### ... Interoptopus generates

| Language | Crate | Sample Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C# (incl. Unity) | [**interoptopus_backend_csharp**](https://crates.io/crates/interoptopus_backend_csharp) | [Interop.cs](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_csharp/tests/output/Interop.cs) |
| C | [**interoptopus_backend_c**](https://crates.io/crates/interoptopus_backend_c) | [my_header.h](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_c/tests/output/my_header.h) |
| Python [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) | [**interoptopus_backend_cpython_cffi**](https://crates.io/crates/interoptopus_backend_cpython_cffi) | [reference.py](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_cpython_cffi/tests/output/reference_project.py) |
| Your language | Write your own backend<sup>1</sup> | - |

<sup>1</sup> Create your own backend in just a few hours. No pull request needed. [Pinkie promise](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/FAQ.md#new-backends).

### Getting Started üçº

If you ...
- want to **create a new API** see the [**example projects**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/examples),
- need to **support a new language** or rewrite a backend, [**copy and adapt the C backend**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_backend_c).

### Features

- explicit, type-safe, **single source of truth** API definition in Rust,
- **quality-of-life [patterns](crate::patterns)** on **both sides** (e.g., [options](crate::patterns::option), [slices](crate::patterns::slice), [services](crate::patterns::service), ...)
- **minimal on dependencies**, build time, tooling impact,
- if your **project compiles your bindings should work**<sup>&#42;*cough*&#42;</sup> (i.e., generated and callable),
- **extensible**, multiple backends, **easy to support new languages**, fully **customizable**,
- **no scripts needed**, `cargo build` + `cargo test` **can produce and test** (if lang installed) generated bindings


### Supported Rust Constructs
See the [**reference project**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src); it lists all supported constructs including:
- [functions](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/functions.rs) (`extern "C"` functions and delegates)
- [types](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/types.rs) (primitives, composite, enums (numeric only), opaques, references, pointers, ...)
- [constants](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/constants.rs) (primitive constants; results of const evaluation)
- [patterns](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/patterns) (ASCII pointers, options, slices, classes, ...)

As a rule of thumb we recommend to be slightly conservative with your signatures and always "think C", since other languages don't track lifetimes
well and it's is easy to accidentally pass an outlived pointer or doubly alias a `&mut X` on reentrant functions.


### Performance üèÅ

Generated low-level bindings should be "zero cost" w.r.t. hand-crafted bindings for that language. However, even hand-crafted bindings
have an inherent, language-specific cost. For C# that cost can be almost 0, for Python CFFI it can be high. Patterns and convenience
helpers might add additional overhead.

If you **need API design guidance** the following (wip) [**C# call-cost table**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_csharp/benches/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md)<sup>üî•</sup> can help.

### Current Status

- June 20, 2021 - Alpha. Has generated simple working<sup>TM</sup> bindings for a few projects for a week now, many things missing.
- June 13, 2021 - Pre-alpha. Has generated C#, C, Python-CFFI bindings at least once, many things missing, untested.


### FAQ

- [FAQ and Safety Guides](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/FAQ.md).

### Contributing

PRs are welcome.

- Bug fixes can be submitted directly. Major changes should be filed as issues
first.

- Anything that would make previously working bindings change behavior or stop compiling
is a major change; which doesn't mean we're opposed to breaking stuff before 1.0, just that
we'd like to talk about it before it happens.

- New features or patterns must be materialized in the reference project and accompanied by
an interop test (i.e., a backend test running C# / Python against a DLL invoking that code)
in at least one included backend.
