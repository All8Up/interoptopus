//! # Interoptopus üêô
//!
//! Why export to only a single language when you can have them all? The polyglot binding generator for your library.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! Huh?
//! - Imagine you are writing this cool API and want the world to have it.
//! - The world, however, is running Unity, C, Python, ... all at the same time.
//! - "Not a problem", you say, "I'll just use Interoptopus".
//!
//! And our hero lived happily<sup>*</sup> ever after.
//!
//! <sub>*Actual results may depend on other life choices.</sub>
//!
//! ## Code you write ...
//!
//! ```rust
//! use interoptopus::{ffi_function, ffi_type, inventory};
//!
//! #[ffi_type]
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct Vec2 {
//!     pub x: f32,
//!     pub y: f32,
//! }
//!
//! #[ffi_function]
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn my_function(input: Vec2) {
//!     println!("{}", input.x);
//! }
//!
//! inventory!(ffi_inventory, [], [my_function], []);
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ## ... Interoptopus generates
//!
//! | Language | Crate | Sample Output |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | C# (incl. Unity) | [**interoptopus_backend_csharp**](https://crates.io/crates/interoptopus_backend_csharp) | [Interop.cs](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_csharp/tests/output/Interop.cs) |
//! | C | [**interoptopus_backend_c**](https://crates.io/crates/interoptopus_backend_c) | [my_header.h](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_backend_c/tests/output/my_header.h) |

//! | Your language | Write your own backend<sup>1</sup> | - |
//!
//! <sup>1</sup> Create your own backend in just a few hours. No pull request needed. [Pinkie promise](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/FAQ.md#new-backends).
//!
//! ## Getting Started üçº
//!
//! If you ...
//! - want to **create a new API** see the [**example projects**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/examples),
//! - need to **support a new language** or rewrite a backend, [**copy and adapt the C backend**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_backend_c).
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - explicit, type-safe, **single source of truth** API definition in Rust,
//! - **quality-of-life [patterns](crate::patterns)** on **both sides** (e.g., [options](crate::patterns::option), [slices](crate::patterns::slice), [services](crate::patterns::service), ...)
//! - **minimal on dependencies**, build time, tooling impact,
//! - if your **project compiles your bindings should work**<sup>&#42;*cough*&#42;</sup> (i.e., generated and callable),
//! - **extensible**, multiple backends, **easy to support new languages**, fully **customizable**,
//! - **no scripts needed**, `cargo build` + `cargo test` **can produce and test** (if lang installed) generated bindings
//!
//!
//! ## Supported Rust Constructs
//! See the [**reference project**](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src); it lists all supported constructs including:
//! - [functions](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/functions.rs) (`extern "C"` functions and delegates)
//! - [types](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/types.rs) (primitives, composite, enums (numeric only), opaques, references, pointers, ...)
//! - [constants](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/constants.rs) (primitive constants; results of const evaluation)
//! - [patterns](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/tree/master/interoptopus_reference_project/src/patterns) (ASCII pointers, options, slices, classes, ...)
//!
//! As a rule of thumb we recommend to be slightly conservative with your signatures and always "think C", since other languages don't track lifetimes
//! well and it's is easy to accidentally pass an outlived pointer or doubly alias a `&mut X` on reentrant functions.
//!
//!
//! ## Runtime Performance
//!
//! - Generated low-level bindings should be "zero cost" w.r.t. hand-crafted bindings for that language.
//! - Even hand-crafted bindings have an inherent, language-specific cost. For C# it can be almost 0, for Python CFFI it can be high.
//! - Patterns and convenience helpers might add additional overhead.
//!
//! If you need API design guidance the following (wip) [C# call-cost table]() can help.
//!
//! ## Current Status
//!
//! - June 20, 2021 - Alpha. Has generated simple working<sup>TM</sup> bindings for a few projects for a week now, many things missing.
//! - June 13, 2021 - Pre-alpha. Has generated C#, C, Python-CFFI bindings at least once, many things missing, untested.
//!
//!
//! ## FAQ
//!
//! - [FAQ and Safety Guides](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus/blob/master/FAQ.md).
//!
//! ## Contributing
//!
//! PRs are welcome.
//!
//! - Bug fixes can be submitted directly. Major changes should be filed as issues
//! first.
//!
//! - Anything that would make previously working bindings change behavior or stop compiling
//! is a major change; which doesn't mean we're opposed to breaking stuff before 1.0, just that
//! we'd like to talk about it before it happens.
//!
//! - New features or patterns must be materialized in the reference project and accompanied by
//! an interop test (i.e., a backend test running C# / Python against a DLL invoking that code)
//! in at least one included backend.

/// **The** macro to define your library, ties everything together!
///
/// This macro produces an "inventory function", which can be ingested by backends. The function
/// will have the signature `fn f() -> Library`, where [`Library`] represents all functions,
/// types, constants and documentation exported by this crate over the FFI boundary.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This macro must be invoked with exactly 4 parameters:
///
/// ```ignore
/// # use interoptopus::inventory_function;
/// inventory_function!(symbol, consts, functions, patterns);
/// ```
///
/// Where
/// - `symbol` - the name of the exported inventory function producing a [`Library`],
/// - `consts` - a list of [`#[ffi_constant]`](crate::ffi_constant) constants to include `[C1, C2, ...]`,
/// - `functions` - a list of [`#[ffi_function]`](crate::ffi_function) functions to include `[f1, f2, ...]`,
/// - `patterns` - a list of [`LibraryPattern`](crate::patterns::LibraryPattern) to include `[p1, ...]`,
///
/// Any of `consts`, `functions` or `patters` can be an empty list `[]` instead. Types are always
/// inferred automatically based on the used functions.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use interoptopus::{ffi_function, ffi_constant};
///
/// #[ffi_constant]
/// const MY_CONSTANT: u8 = 1;
///
/// #[ffi_function]
/// #[no_mangle]
/// pub extern "C" fn f(_x: u8) {}
///
/// interoptopus::inventory!(
///     my_inventory_function,
///     [ MY_CONSTANT ],
///     [ f ],
///     []
/// );
/// ```
///
/// You can then use `my_inventory_function`, which will return a [`Library`], in a backend to
/// produce bindings to your language.
