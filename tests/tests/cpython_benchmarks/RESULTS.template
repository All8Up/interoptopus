# FFI Call Overheads

The numbers below are to help FFI design decisions by giving order-of-magnitude estimates how
expensive certain constructs are.

Times were determined by running the given construct 1M times, taking the elapsed time in ticks,
and computing the cost per 1k invocations.


## System

The following system was used:    
    
```
System: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, 64 GB RAM; Windows 11
rustc: stable (i.e., 1.82 or later)
profile: --release
Python: 3.11.5
```
    
## Results

| Construct | ns per call |
| --- | --- |
